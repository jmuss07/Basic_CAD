## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection



[Have a link to my Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/493463e1e1a526fb559e972d/w/8847d48b6788f1b2821659f2/e/52c6d9218d9e03f7c28bec72)

The base was fairly simple to complete. The onlhy challenging part was adding a pattern for the holes, but now that I have it figured out, it's actually pretty simple!
