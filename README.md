## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges. There is also a large hole around the center point that has a diameter of 25mm.

### Reflection





The base was fairly simple to complete. The only challenging part was adding a pattern for the holes, but now that I have it figured out, it's actually pretty simple!

## Mount

### Description
The next part to complete was the mount. For this, we were supposed to create a square extrusion that was 120mmm X 120mm, with as height of 8mm. It also has four holes that are 80mm apart with a diameter of 10mm. These holes are also 20mm from the edge. There is also a large hole in the center that has a diameter of 25mm.

### Reflection
This part was also fairly simple to complete, and I honestly did not have any trouble with it.

### Reflection
This was also a simple part to complete, and was actually quite enjoyable to work on.
